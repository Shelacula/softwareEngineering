Something that didn't go great in our project was when we had to create an API for assignment 2. 

 

Why did we struggle? 

Originally, we tried filling in the API with information we didn’t know yet while not knowing what an API was. 

 

Why did we fill it in? 

Our group didn’t realize that the API first needed to have a shell with parameters with information as a placeholder before you put in the actual code in other files that require the API 

 

Why did we not realize we needed parameters with no actual code? 

Our group was trying to skip a few steps thinking we could get it done faster as a group of three and got ahead of ourselves. 

 
Why did we get ahead of ourselves? 

Our group didn’t realize in the PowerPoint slides the code that was written wasn’t actual code but a framework to just help us in the future 

 
Why didn’t we read extra carefully?  

Since we thought we thought we were smarter and understood the concept better than we thought we did. Now we know to read extra carefully so we do everything correctly the first time. Next time we’ll utilize more of our resources like Google and Office Hours to get a deeper understanding of the concept.
